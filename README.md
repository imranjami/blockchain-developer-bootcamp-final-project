Community Artboard

1. Users will have the ability if they are holding a specific NFT in their wallet to draw one pixel on an artboard which will have a web interface.

2. The web interface will be 2000 x 2000 pixels and the user will be able to specify a color and a plot point on the canvas.

3. Once the user has drawn a pixel, the web interface will update.

4. The user will only be able to do this once every day.
